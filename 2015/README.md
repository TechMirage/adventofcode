# Advent of Code 2015

This is a repository where we work on solving the Advent of Code 2015 puzzles. We are very late in getting started on these, but I figure the practice can't be a bad thing and I want to be coding more again. Solving puzzles is always really fun for me and my Python skills have definitely increased since 2015, so even though I've solved a few of these before, I'm going to start from the beginning for completion-ism sake!

I will be keeping track of days and whether they're solved or not here... so if you want to see the solutions, feel free to click the appropriate section of the table and check them out!
